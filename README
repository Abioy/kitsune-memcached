Kitsune-enabled Memcached
=======================

This is a version of memcached patched to support dynamic
updating using Kitsune.

Building
========

To build all versions, simply run `make` in the root directory. To
build a specific version, run `make` in its directory.

If Kitsune is not installed in your PATH, the environment variable
KITSUNE_PATH must refer to a valid Kitsune installation (the `bin`
directory of the core Kitsune repository will work).

Memcached's build depends are libevent and libsasl2. Build
dependencies can be easily installed on Debian-derived systems by
running `apt-get build-dep memcached`.

The build process will produce a shared object, `memcached.so`, in
each version's subdirectory.

Running
=======

To run Kitsune-enabled memcached, use the Kitsune driver program:

`driver memcached.so <memcached arguments>`

Updating
========

To update memcached, use Kitsune's `doupd` script:

`doupd <memcached pid> <new icecast version.so>`

For a dynamic update to work, the target version must have been built
with the running version specified as its previous version. All
versions of memcached are, by default, built to update from the last
available version, except the first version, which is built to update
from itself.
